# Buffer Overflow 0


Description
Smash the stack
Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available here. You can view source here. And connect with it using:
nc saturn.picoctf.net 65443

# Hints

1. How can you trigger the flag to print?
2. If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters. Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.
3. Run man gets and read the BUGS section. How many characters can the program really read?

## Steps

- Play around with the program to get a feel for what it does. We see that the program takes user input, let's note this as a potential attack vector. 

**Put snippet of program here** 

- I wanted to take a peak at the code just out of curiosity. To me, I think it is good to get an understanding of what is going on underneath the hood in order to get possible ideas on how to exploit the program. I'll post a code snippet with comments to detail how I enumerate functionality throughout the program. (I'll make it as decipherable as possible)

**Put snippet here**

- One comment that I want to pay special attention to is the one referencing the byte size of the **insert variable name here** variable. My first thought seeing this is if it is possible to overwrite this variable with the input taking from the program. Using knowledge of a character being exactly 1 byte, let's see if we are able to supply more than 16 characters (more than 16 bytes) to overflow the variable.


**Put success here**

- WHOLA! On the first attempt at supplying a string of 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' resulting in 17 bytes (17 a's = 17 characters = 17 bytes), we were able to retrieve the flag from the program.
